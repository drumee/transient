# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository builds, packages, and distributes the **Drumee** sovereign data platform through two channels from one source of truth (`config/drumee.yaml`):

- **Container channel** — Docker Compose stack (`scripts/dev-up.sh`, `scripts/get-drumee.sh`)
- **Native Debian channel** — `.deb` packages installable via `apt install drumee`

Each subdirectory under `infra/`, `schemas/`, `server/`, `ui/`, `static/` is a self-contained package builder that clones source from `git@github.com:drumee/`, compiles it, and produces a `.deb` via `dh_make` + `dpkg-buildpackage`. The `deploy/docker/` tree holds Dockerfiles and entrypoints for the container channel.

## Runtime Architecture

Each Drumee endpoint runs **three PM2 processes**:

| Process | Mode | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | fork | Page serving + WebSocket (port 23000) |
| `main/service` | cluster | REST API workers (port 24000, scaled by RAM: 2 GB→2, 6 GB→3, >6 GB→4) |
| `factory` | fork | Schema factory — replenishes entity pool (autorestart disabled) |

All service URLs follow `/-/svc/module.method` — no hardcoded routes.

### Database Structure

**`yp`** — Central system database: `sys_conf`, `domain`, `vhost`, `entity`, `drumate`, `hub`, `organisation`, `settings`, `privilege`, mailserver tables.

**Per-entity databases** — One database per user and hub, created by `entity_create` stored procedure. Contains `mfs_*`, `permission`, `media`, and activity tables.

Five additional system databases: `utils`, `mailserver`, `template`, `trash`, plus per-hub/per-drumate sharded databases.

## Building Packages

### Prerequisites

- **No root** — all scripts check `$UID` and abort if root
- **Git SSH access** to `git@github.com:drumee/` (private repos)
- **GPG key** matching maintainer email in `debian/changelog` (in local keyring)
- **Node.js 22** — the `debian/control` files still say `nodejs (>= 20)`, but the
  container images and `scripts/install-native.sh` (NodeSource) install **22**, and
  the WireGuard agent needs it. Treat 22 as the real baseline; the `>= 20` pin is
  deliberately not bumped (see the Node 22 guard under WireGuard).
- **Debian build tools**: `dh-make`, `dpkg-buildpackage`, `debhelper`, `build-essential`

### Commands

```bash
# Single package
infra/build.sh
schemas/build.sh
server/build.sh
ui/build.sh
static/build.sh
meta/build.sh                              # drumee metapackage (pure deps)
schemas-patch/build.sh --manifest=auto     # incremental schema patch

# All main packages in dependency order
./build-all.sh                             # infra → schemas → ui → server
```

Build outputs land in `<package>/build/<version>/`. Set `DEB_BUILD_TARGET=/path` to copy `.deb` files there (only `infra`, `schemas`, `server` honor this).

### Build flags

Most scripts take **no** flags — version and email are read from `<package>/debian/changelog` via `get_version`/`get_email`. `get_build_dir` unconditionally wipes and recreates the staging dir, so `--force` is unnecessary. Exceptions:

| Script | Flag | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ui/build.sh` | `--compile=yes\|no` | Parsed but **not honoured** — webpack always runs |
| `ui/build.sh` | `--enable-api=yes\|no` | Also compile the `api` webpack target (default `no`) |
| `schemas-patch/build.sh` | `--manifest=auto\|<file>` | **Required** — selects the patch manifest |
| `schemas-patch/build.sh` | `<N>` (positional) | Commit depth for `--manifest=auto` (default `2`) |
| `builder/build.sh` | `pull` (positional) | Pull the `setup` repo before packaging |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DEB_BUILD_TARGET=/path` | Copy `.deb` there after build (infra, schemas, server only) |
| `SEEDS_DIR=/path` | Source for schemas seeds archive (default `$HOME/docker/data/seeds/`) |
| `REPO_BASE=git@...` | Override GitHub base URL for `bundle()` (local mirror) |

### schemas prerequisites — the seed

`schemas/build.sh` must ship a `mariabackup` physical snapshot at
`schemas/var/tmp/drumee/seeds.tgz`. Resolution order (in `schemas/build.sh`):

1. reuse an existing `var/tmp/drumee/seeds.tgz`;
2. archive `$SEEDS_DIR` (default `$HOME/docker/data/seeds/`) if that dir exists;
3. **build one offline** via `scripts/build-seed.sh` — no insider snapshot needed.

`schemas/seeds/` is gitignored. See **Offline Seed Builder** below.

## Offline Seed Builder

Removes the last "insider artifact" from the build (`docs/reproducible-builds.md`,
roadmap 0.6). It produces `seeds.tgz` from source inside one throwaway container:
a local MariaDB + Redis, base DBs from the `schemas` repo's `templates/factory/`,
the **entity pool stocked** via `server-team`'s `offline/factory` (an empty pool
trips the `EMPTY_FACTORY` guard in schemas' postinst), then
`mariabackup --backup/--prepare` tarred in the exact layout
`setup-schemas/bin/install` consumes (`tar --one-top-level=seeds` →
`mariabackup --copy-back`).

```bash
scripts/build-seed.sh [--out=PATH]          # default out: schemas/var/tmp/drumee/seeds.tgz
scripts/check-seed.sh [--seed=PATH]         # interactive shell on a restored seed
scripts/check-seed.sh -- mariadb -N -B -e 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM yp.entity'
```

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/Dockerfile.seed` | Toolbox image (`drumee/seed:$TAG`) — MariaDB + mariabackup + Redis + Node 22 |
| `scripts/seed-entrypoint.sh` | The seed flow (start DB → init → populate → mariabackup → tar) |
| `scripts/Dockerfile.seed-check` / `seed-check-entrypoint.sh` | Restore a seed the way the `.deb` does, then hand over a shell |

**Sources are bind-mounted read-only and their existing `node_modules` are
reused** — so no access to the private `@drumee` registry is needed in-container.
`SERVER_SRC` (default `../server-team`, must already have `node_modules/@drumee`),
`SETUP_SCHEMAS_SRC` and `SCHEMAS_SRC` (default to the trees `schemas/build.sh`
already cloned under `schemas/src/`). Other knobs: `TAG`, `POOL_COUNT` (default
10), `DRUMEE_DOMAIN_NAME`.

**Design rule worth preserving:** steps 1–2 reuse the container channel's assets
verbatim (`deploy/docker/schemas-init.sh`, `populate-entrypoint.sh`,
`container-populate.js`, pulled in via the `helpers` build context) pointed at a
loopback MariaDB instead of the compose `mariadb` service. Both channels are
therefore seeded by the same vetted code paths — don't fork these scripts for the
seed builder.

## Install Order and Dependencies

```
drumee-infra → drumee-schemas → drumee-static → drumee-server-pod → drumee-ui-pod
```

`drumee-patch` can be applied after `drumee-schemas`.

```
drumee-infra
└── drumee-schemas   (mariadb-server, mariadb-client)
    ├── drumee-static
    ├── drumee-server-pod  (nginx, redis, ffmpeg, libreoffice, graphicsmagick, …)
    └── drumee-ui-pod      (nodejs, git)
        └── drumee-patch   (mariadb-server, mariadb-client)
```

## Post-Install Behavior

- **drumee-infra**: runs `setup-infra/bin/install` (root) — renders 88 lodash templates into `/etc/drumee/`, `/etc/nginx/`, `/etc/bind/`, `/etc/prosody/`, `/etc/jitsi/`, `/etc/postfix/`, MariaDB, Coturn. Sets up SSL (ACME/self-signed/own certs), DNS (BIND9), DKIM, Prosody XMPP, PM2 ecosystem, and crontab (cert renewal, tmp cleanup, watchdog, DB/storage backups).
- **drumee-schemas**: runs `setup-schemas/bin/install` (root) — restores MariaDB from seeds via `mariabackup`, creates system accounts (nobody, guest, system, admin), provisions initial hubs, imports wallpapers/tutorials, generates RSA key pair, sends welcome email with password-reset link.
- **drumee-server-pod**: sources `/etc/drumee/drumee.sh`, applies pending patches from `/var/lib/drumee/postinstall/patch.sh`.
- **drumee-patch**: stages patch files; applied at next server startup (not immediately).
- **drumee-static**, **drumee-ui-pod**: no special post-install.

## Config System (Single Source of Truth)

`config/drumee.yaml` drives both channels. `config/render.mjs` is a dependency-free YAML parser + validator + renderer:

```bash
node config/render.mjs validate --config config/drumee.yaml
node config/render.mjs all --config config/drumee.yaml --out-dir out
# Commands: validate | env | compose | debconf | caddyfile | all
```

Outputs: `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, `install.conf` (debconf preseed), `Caddyfile`. Null passwords in `database.password`/`redis.password` trigger automatic strong-random generation.

`config/drumee.schema.json` is the JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) defining the config contract. `config/drumee.example.yaml` is the annotated template.

## WireGuard Peer Coordination

Lets a Drumee node be reached from outside **without opening a port on the
user's router**. **Disabled by default**, and available on **both channels** —
systemd units from `drumee-infra` natively, a `wireguard` compose service in
containers. This is
the client half; the server half lives in the separate **`drumee/coord-server`**
repo (signaling server + UDP reflector + relay). The two repos share a config
contract (`coordinator_url`, `reflector_host`, `listen_port`) and must stay in
sync — a change to the message protocol on one side needs the matching change
on the other.

### Why it exists

Plugging a box into a home LAN gives it a routable (IPv6) address for free, but
the router's stateful firewall drops unsolicited inbound, so `:443` is
unreachable. Coordination exploits the one thing that always works — outbound.
The node holds an outbound WSS connection to the coordination server; when a
client wants in, both sides are told the other's public `IP:port` and fire
their WireGuard handshake at the same instant, punching each firewall's return
pinhole. Result: a direct, end-to-end encrypted P2P tunnel. The server never
sees traffic content. If the direct path fails (e.g. symmetric NAT), traffic
falls back through the server's relay.

### Components (in this repo)

| Piece | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `bootstrap.sh` | `infra/var/lib/drumee/wireguard/` | First boot: generate keypair, bring up `wg0` on a **fixed** port |
| `agent.js` | `infra/var/lib/drumee/wireguard/` | Long-lived: probe reflector, register over WSS, program peers on `peer-info` |
| `drumee-wg-bootstrap.service` | `infra/etc/systemd/system/` | oneshot, ordered **before** the agent |
| `drumee-wg-agent.service` | `infra/etc/systemd/system/` | `Restart=always`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN` only |
| `wireguard.json` | generated into `/etc/drumee/conf.d/` by `postinst` | **Not** shipped as a conffile — avoids dpkg upgrade prompts |
| `Dockerfile.wireguard` + `wireguard-entrypoint.sh` | `deploy/docker/` | Container channel: **copies** `bootstrap.sh`/`agent.js` from the infra tree (build context `wg=`), renders `wireguard.json` from `WIREGUARD_*` env |

The private key is generated on-device and never leaves it; only the public key
reaches the coordination server. The two channels must run byte-identical
coordination logic (shared protocol with `coord-server`) — hence the copy from
`infra/var/lib/drumee/wireguard/` instead of a second implementation.

### Config contract

`config/drumee.yaml` — one block, both channels:

```yaml
wireguard:
  enabled: false
  coordinator: coord.drumee.tech
  listen_port: 51820      # MUST stay fixed — the NAT mapping is probed from it
  reflector_port: 51821
```

Defined in `config/drumee.schema.json` and validated in `config/render.mjs`
(`validate`): ports must be 1–65535, `coordinator` required when enabled, and
**`enabled` is rejected together with `instance.local_mode`** (NAT traversal is
meaningless on a LAN-only box). `render.mjs debconf` emits four keys:
`wireguard_enabled`, `wireguard_coordinator`, `wireguard_listen_port`,
`wireguard_reflector_port`; `render.mjs env` emits the matching `WIREGUARD_*`
and adds `wireguard` to `COMPOSE_PROFILES` when enabled.

### Install flow (native)

The debconf `config` script asks the WireGuard questions **only when
`local_mode` is false**. `postinst` bridges the answers to `WIREGUARD_*` env
vars, writes `/etc/drumee/conf.d/wireguard.json`, and enables/starts the two
units (or leaves them inactive when disabled). To change later:
`dpkg-reconfigure drumee-infra`.

`scripts/install-native.sh` asks the question itself (from `/dev/tty`) and
preseeds those four keys before `apt install`. It must: on the documented
`curl … | sudo bash` path stdin is the pipe, so debconf never gets a terminal
and would silently take defaults. The script then hands `/dev/tty` to apt so the
remaining questions work too. `WIREGUARD_ENABLED` / `WIREGUARD_COORDINATOR` /
`…_LISTEN_PORT` / `…_REFLECTOR_PORT` skip the prompt.

### Install flow (container)

`scripts/get-drumee.sh` offers it as a **4th** answer to "How will people reach
this server?" — *Behind a home router*. That mode writes the `wireguard:` block,
keeps `local_mode: false`, and uses `tls.mode: self-signed` (with no inbound
port, ACME HTTP-01 cannot be answered). Opt-in on the domain/IP modes with
`WIREGUARD_ENABLED=true`; forced off in local mode. If the agent image is
neither pullable nor built, the wizard disables coordination with a message
rather than letting `compose up` fail on a missing image.

The rendered service uses `network_mode: host` + `cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]` — `wg0`
must live in the host namespace so the tunnel reaches the ports the proxy
publishes there and the probed NAT mapping is the host's own. That also excludes
the `drumee` network (mutually exclusive with host mode); the agent only talks to
the coordinator. The keypair persists on the `drumee_cred` volume. **The host
must have the `wireguard` kernel module** — a container cannot supply it.

### Two design decisions worth knowing

- **`wireguard.json` is generated by `postinst`, not shipped** in `infra/etc/`.
  This diverges from the other `conf.d/*.json` (which are shipped) but avoids
  dpkg treating it as a conffile and prompting on every upgrade.
- **Node 22 guard in `postinst`.** The agent uses the global `WebSocket` API
  (stable from Node 22), but the package only `Depends: nodejs (>= 20)`.
  `postinst` checks the running major version and, if < 22, leaves coordination
  disabled with a clear message instead of installing a service that
  crash-loops at boot. Bumping `Depends` was avoided because it would affect the
  whole stack.

### Why the listen port must stay fixed

The agent learns its public `IP:port` by probing the coordination server's UDP
reflector, which echoes back what it observes. That mapping is only usable if
the probe leaves from the **same** port `wg0` uses. A random port would yield a
mapping that points nowhere. Keep `listen_port` fixed in config; don't let
`wg-quick`-style tooling randomize it.

### Testing (lives in `coord-server`, references this repo)

The `coord-server` repo carries the test harness; the netns test points back
here for `agent.js` via `DRUMEE_AGENT_SRC`:

```bash
# Layer 1 — signaling logic, runs anywhere (no root, no wireguard module)
DRUMEE_AGENT_SRC=$PWD/infra/var/lib/drumee/wireguard/agent.js \
  bash ../coord-server/test/signaling-e2e.sh

# Layer 2 — real WireGuard through simulated NAT (root + wireguard module + Node 22)
sudo DRUMEE_AGENT_SRC=$PWD/infra/var/lib/drumee/wireguard/agent.js \
  bash ../coord-server/test/netns-e2e.sh
```

Layer 1 is stable (35+ consecutive passes). Layer 2 has **not** been run yet —
it needs a host with the `wireguard` kernel module (a VM, not the dev
container). It is the test that actually proves reachability-without-port-open
on real kernel WireGuard.

### Open points / validation TODO

- **Probe socket bind** (`agent.js`) — **now measured, and it does NOT work.**
  The probe tries to reuse `wg0`'s port via `SO_REUSEADDR` and falls back to an
  ephemeral port when the bind fails. On real kernel WireGuard the bind *does*
  fail: running the new container image (`--cap-add NET_ADMIN`, module present)
  logs `probe socket bind failed, falling back to ephemeral port: bind
  EADDRINUSE 0.0.0.0:51820`. So `SO_REUSEADDR` does not let userspace share the
  port with the kernel-side wg socket, and the mapping the reflector observes
  belongs to the ephemeral port — it points nowhere for the real tunnel. Hole
  punching therefore cannot work as written; every session would fall back to
  the relay. Fixing it means changing how the endpoint is learned (e.g. have the
  reflector observe the wg handshake itself), which is a **protocol change shared
  with `coord-server`** — do not patch one side alone.
- **`WG_RELAY_PUBKEY`** must be set on the coordination server (from
  `/etc/wireguard/server_public.key`) or relay fallback returns a clear
  `connect-failed` instead of relaying.
- **Symmetric NAT** always falls back to relay — known limitation, not a bug.
- **The client APP is the connect initiator**; the shipped agent is purely
  passive (it waits for `peer-info`). The initiator protocol reference is
  `coord-server/test/initiator.js`.

## Container Channel

```bash
scripts/build-images-local.sh   # build images from local source (tag: local)
scripts/dev-up.sh               # render config + bring up compose stack
scripts/dev-down.sh             # stop stack (KEEP_DATA=1 to preserve volumes)
```

Compose orchestration order: `mariadb` healthcheck → `schemas-init` → `ui-build` → `schemas-populate` → `server-pod` + `factory`, fronted by a `caddy` proxy.

Dockerfiles live in `deploy/docker/`. Key files:
- `ecosystem.config.js` — pm2 config (`--restPort 24000`, `--pushPort 23000`, `--http-port`, `--conf-path`)
- `entrypoint.sh` — sources `/etc/drumee/drumee.sh`, applies pending patches, launches pm2
- `schemas-init.sh` — idempotent DB bootstrap (creates `yp`, `utils`, `mailserver`, `template`, `trash`)
- `container-populate.js` — creates system accounts + RSA keypair + entity pool
- `container-factory.js` — daemon replenishing the pool (watermark-based, default 10)

Env vars for local builds: `SERVER_SRC`, `UI_SRC`, `SCHEMAS_SRC`, `SETUP_SCHEMAS_SRC`, `SETUP_INFRA_SRC`.

## Release & Version Management

### release-manifest.yaml

The authoritative version file. `product` is the user-facing release-train version; component versions are internal:

```yaml
product: 1.0.0
infra: 1.2.11
schemas: 2.6.99
server: 2.9.73
...
```

### Version coherence workflow

```bash
scripts/check-versions.sh          # verify changelogs match manifest (CI guard)
scripts/check-versions.sh --sync   # auto-update changelogs from manifest
meta/make-control.sh               # regenerate metapackage deps pinned to manifest
meta/make-control.sh --check       # CI guard: fail if out of sync
```

To bump a version: edit `release-manifest.yaml`, then run `--sync` + `make-control.sh`.

### update-changelog.sh

`server/`, `static/`, `ui/`, `schemas-patch/` each have one. Compares `debian/changelog` version against the upstream `package.json` version and picks whichever is **higher**. Without `--message`, it pulls the last 5 non-merge git commits as bullet points. Called automatically by `server/build.sh`, `ui/build.sh`, and `static/build.sh` (not `schemas-patch`).

### Debian changelog format

```
<package-name> (<version>) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change description

 -- Maintainer Name <email>  Day, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS +TZOFF
```

Two-space indent before bullets and single-space before `--` are required by `dpkg-parsechangelog`.

## Publishing & Distribution

### APT repository (flat, self-hosted at `apt.drumee.net`)

```bash
scripts/publish-apt.sh --debs=DIR --out=REPO_DIR [--key=EMAIL_OR_KEYID]
scripts/deploy-apt-repo.sh --host=USER@HOST [--repo-dir=DIR] [--domain=DOMAIN]
```

`publish-apt.sh` generates `Packages`, `Packages.gz`, `Release`, `InRelease`, `Release.gpg`, and `drumee-archive-keyring.asc` into a flat directory (no `dists/pool` tree). Requires `apt-utils` (for `apt-ftparchive`) and `gpg`.

`deploy-apt-repo.sh` rsyncs that directory to the VPS document root (default `/var/www/apt.drumee.net`), installs an nginx vhost for the domain (default `apt.drumee.net`), and reloads nginx. TLS is set up separately with certbot; `APT_LOCAL_DIR` selects the local repo dir (default `apt-repo`).

Clients configure:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apt.drumee.net/drumee-archive-keyring.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/drumee.asc >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/drumee.asc] https://apt.drumee.net/ ./" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/drumee.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install drumee
```

`scripts/install-native.sh` does this automatically (`APT_URL`/`KEYRING_URL` override the defaults).

### Container images

```bash
scripts/publish-images.sh   # build + push to registry
# Env: REGISTRY, TAG, PUSH=1, ALSO_LATEST, ALSO_STABLE, MEDIA_DEPS, INSTALL_DEPS
```

### Full site publish (apt + Pages)

```bash
APT_SSH_HOST=deploy@vps GH_TOKEN=<token> scripts/publish-site.sh --debs=out-debs [--key=KEYID]
```

Builds the flat repo once, then deploys it to two independent targets: `apt.drumee.net` over rsync/SSH (`APT_SSH_HOST`, `APT_REPO_DIR`, `APT_DOMAIN`) and the `get.drumee.com` Pages content — installers, renderer, keyring, CLIs — to `PAGES_REPO` (`GH_TOKEN`). Each target is skipped with a notice when its credential is absent; setting neither is an error. `scripts/install-native.sh` is copied into the flat repo so `https://apt.drumee.net/install-native.sh` serves the bootstrap without depending on Pages.

## Deployment

### Manual native install

```bash
# On build machine
./build-all.sh
scp infra/build/drumee-infra_*.deb schemas/build/drumee-schemas_*.deb \
    server/build/drumee-server-pod_*.deb ui/build/drumee-ui-pod_*.deb \
    static/build/drumee-static_*.deb user@server:/tmp/

# On target server — install in dependency order
dpkg -i /tmp/drumee-infra_*.deb
dpkg -i /tmp/drumee-schemas_*.deb
dpkg -i /tmp/drumee-static_*.deb
dpkg -i /tmp/drumee-server-pod_*.deb
dpkg -i /tmp/drumee-ui-pod_*.deb
```

### Patch-only update

```bash
schemas-patch/build.sh --manifest=auto
scp schemas-patch/build/drumee-patch_*.deb user@server:/tmp/
# On server:
dpkg -i /tmp/drumee-patch_*.deb
drumee restart   # patches are staged on install, applied at restart
```

## Testing

```bash
tests/run-all.sh             # CI suite (no private source or images needed)
tests/smoke-config.sh        # 10-assertion config rendering smoke test
tests/smoke-container.sh     # container install smoke test (needs Docker)
tests/e2e-local.sh           # full-stack E2E against tag:local images
tests/demo-stack.sh [--keep] # live compose stack from stub images (Docker + internet)
tests/wizard-install.sh      # interactive installer render-only test
tests/native/install-verify.sh        # native channel E2E (disposable Debian container)
tests/native/control-deps.sh         # inter-package dependency ordering check
tests/native/verify-debconf-bridge.sh # preseed → debconf → DRUMEE_* env, in a real .deb install
tests/native/make-seed.sh            # generate bootstrap seeds.tgz for schemas build
```

`run-all.sh` runs: shell syntax (`bash -n`, over `git ls-files '*.sh' 'bin/*'`
excluding `*/src/*`) → ShellCheck → renderer parse → config smoke → version drift
guard → end-to-end render → compose validity (if Docker available) → operator CLI
guards → wizard render → `native/control-deps.sh`.

The heavier suites are **not** in `run-all.sh` and must be run by hand:
`smoke-container.sh`, `e2e-local.sh`, `demo-stack.sh`, `native/install-verify.sh`,
`native/verify-debconf-bridge.sh`. All of them self-`SKIP` (exit 0) when Docker or
Node is unavailable — check their output, not just the exit code.

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — every PR/push to `main` or `feat/**`: shell lint + ShellCheck + `tests/run-all.sh`. No secrets needed.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — on `v*` tags: version coherence guard → build+push images (cosign-signed via GitHub OIDC, SBOM via syft) → build `.deb` packages → native install E2E → publish apt-stable + Pages → container smoke test. Secrets (all gated — missing = skip, not fail): `DRUMEE_SSH_KEY`, `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`/`GPG_PASSPHRASE`, `REGISTRY_TOKEN`, `PAGES_DEPLOY_TOKEN`.

## CLIs

### drumee (PM2 wrapper)

Installed by `drumee-server-pod` to `/usr/sbin/drumee`:

```bash
drumee start|stop|restart [<service>]
drumee restart <user>/service       # restart a specific plugin service
drumee log <service>                # tail PM2 logs
```

### drumee-ctl (lifecycle operator)

Channel-aware (detects container vs. native). In `bin/drumee-ctl`:

```bash
drumee-ctl status|doctor|backup|restore <file>|upgrade [tag]|rollback
```

`doctor` checks Docker/DB/Redis/TLS health. `backup` creates timestamped tgz with DB dump + data + config. Set `DRUMEE_DIR` to point at the compose project.

### drumee-plugin

In `bin/drumee-plugin`:

```bash
drumee-plugin add <source> [--endpoint=E] [--name=N]
drumee-plugin list|remove|enable|disable <ep/name>
drumee-plugin apply <manifest.json>
```

Source can be git URL (`#ref`), local dir, or archive. Installs to `$PLUGIN_DIR/<endpoint>/<name>` (default `/srv/drumee/runtime/plugins/server`). Restarts backend after changes.

## Shared Utilities

`utils/env.sh` — exports runtime path constants (`DRUMEE_ROOT_DIR=/srv/drumee`, `DRUMEE_DATA_DIR=/data`, `DRUMEE_SERVER_HOME`, `DRUMEE_UI_HOME`, `ACME_DIR=/etc/acme`, etc.). Also re-checks `$UID`.

`utils/functions.sh` — provides:
- `bundle <base> <repo-name> <branch> [src-files] [dest-path] [npm-script]` — clone/pull from `${REPO_BASE:-git@github.com:drumee}`, `npm i`, rsync to build dir. On re-runs: `git stash` + `git pull` + `git checkout` instead of fresh clone.
- `bundle_acme <base> <dest>` — clone `acmesh-official/acme.sh` from GitHub (not Drumee)
- `get_version <base>` / `get_email <base>` — parse from `debian/changelog`
- `get_build_dir <dir>` — unconditionally wipe + recreate staging dir
- `copyToTarget <path>` — copy `.deb` to `$DEB_BUILD_TARGET` if set
- Obsolete interactive helpers (`check_version`, `check_email`, `check_build_dir`, `parse_args`) — only `admin/build.sh` still uses the `check_*` flow

## Package Directory Map

| Directory | Package | Source repo(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `infra/` | `drumee-infra` | `setup-infra`, `acme.sh` | Post-install renders 88+ config templates |
| `schemas/` | `drumee-schemas` | `setup-schemas`, `schemas` | Requires `seeds.tgz`; post-install restores MariaDB |
| `server/` | `drumee-server-pod` | `server-team` | Post-install applies pending patches |
| `ui/` | `drumee-ui-pod` | `ui-team` | Webpack build during package build |
| `static/` | `drumee-static` | `static` | No deps, served by nginx |
| `schemas-patch/` | `drumee-patch` | `schemas` | Requires `--manifest` |
| `builder/` | `drumee-bootstrap` | `setup` | Interactive installer, builds unsigned, GitLab fallback |
| `meta/` | `drumee` | — | Metapackage, deps pinned via `make-control.sh` |
| `admin/` | — | — | Admin scripts only (uses interactive `check_*` flow) |

## Key Directories

```
config/         drumee.yaml schema + render.mjs (single source of truth)
deploy/docker/  Dockerfiles, Caddyfile, entrypoints (container channel)
scripts/        build/publish images, get-drumee, dev-up/down, apt repo, seed builder
bin/            drumee-ctl + drumee-plugin CLIs
meta/           drumee metapackage + make-control.sh
tests/          config + container + native + E2E test suites
target/         pre-built artifacts for drumee-bootstrap
docs/           full documentation (quickstart, lifecycle, security, per-package details)
```

Generated / untracked working dirs: `out/` and `out-debs/` (renderer + build
output), `apt-repo/` (local flat repo staged by `publish-apt.sh`), `<pkg>/src/`
(trees cloned by `bundle()`), `<pkg>/build/`. Never edit under `*/src/` — it is
overwritten from the upstream repos on the next build.

## External Documentation

Full docs are in `docs/` and at [drumee.github.io/docs/package-building](https://drumee.github.io/docs/package-building/):
- Per-package deep dives: infra, schemas, server, ui, static, schemas-patch, builder
- Quickstart, first-deploy runbook, production ops, lifecycle, security
- Build pipeline, reproducible builds, release engineering, version management
- `docs/wireguard.md` (peer coordination), `docs/native-audit.md` (native-channel gap audit)

`ROADMAP.md` tracks what is done vs. outstanding per phase, including known
upstream bugs and workarounds — read it before assuming a gap is an oversight.
