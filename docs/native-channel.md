# Native Debian channel

For dedicated Debian/Ubuntu hosts (advanced / IaC). Installs Drumee directly onto
the host via `apt`, configured from a debconf preseed for unattended runs.

## For end users

```bash
# Interactive
curl -fsSL https://apt.drumee.net/install-native.sh | sudo bash

# Unattended — preseed answers rendered from drumee.yaml first
node config/render.mjs debconf --out install.conf
sudo PRESEED=install.conf bash scripts/install-native.sh
```

`apt install drumee` pulls the `drumee` metapackage (`meta/`), which depends on
`drumee-infra`, `drumee-schemas`, `drumee-static`, `drumee-server-pod`,
`drumee-ui-pod`.

## For maintainers — publishing the repo

```bash
./build-all.sh                       # build the component .debs
static/build.sh                      # build drumee-static (REPO_BASE=https://github.com/drumee)
meta/build.sh                        # build the drumee metapackage
scripts/publish-apt.sh --debs=./out-debs --out=/tmp/apt-flat --key=release@drumee.org
APT_LOCAL_DIR=/tmp/apt-flat scripts/deploy-apt-repo.sh   # --host=debian@apt.drumee.net
```

`publish-apt.sh` builds a signed **flat** repo (`apt-ftparchive` + `gpg`), emits
`InRelease`/`Release.gpg`, and exports the public key as
`drumee-archive-keyring.asc`.

`deploy-apt-repo.sh` rsyncs that directory to the VPS document root
(`/var/www/apt.drumee.net` by default), writes an nginx vhost for the domain, and
reloads nginx. Override with `--repo-dir=` / `--domain=`. TLS is provisioned
separately (`certbot --nginx -d apt.drumee.net`); the script prints the follow-up
steps, including uncommenting the port-80 → 443 redirect once the cert exists.

## Certificates: DNS-01, and what works behind a router

Drumee needs a **wildcard** certificate (`example.com` *and* `*.example.com`), so
the ACME challenge is always DNS-01 — opening port 80 does nothing for issuance.
`apt install drumee-infra` asks how to answer it:

| Choice | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **acme-dns-server** (default) | This host becomes the authoritative DNS server (BIND9, TSIG-signed dynamic updates). The domain's NS records must be delegated here and **inbound udp/53 must reach it** — not possible behind a typical home router. |
| **acme-dns-api** | The TXT record is created through your DNS provider's API. **Outbound only, so no port forwarding at all** — the right choice for a box on a home LAN. No local DNS server is installed. |
| **caddy** | The `drumee-caddy` package (a Caddy compiled with `caddy-dns` provider modules) takes 80/443, obtains and renews the certificates itself over DNS-01, and proxies to nginx on internal ports. **Outbound only**, and it can issue wildcards. Asks for the domain, the provider module and the API token. |
| **own** | You supply wildcard certs and give their path. |
| **self-signed** | LAN-only/test instance, no public certificate. |

For `acme-dns-api`, create the credentials file on the host **before** installing,
mode `0600`, exporting an [acme.sh dnsapi](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi)
name plus its variables:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0700 /etc/drumee/credential
sudo tee /etc/drumee/credential/dns-api.env >/dev/null <<'ENV'
export ACME_PROVIDER=ovh
export OVH_AK=...  OVH_AS=...  OVH_CK=...
ENV
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/drumee/credential/dns-api.env
```

Declaratively, the same thing in `drumee.yaml` (the path only — never the
secrets), which `render.mjs debconf` turns into the preseed:

```yaml
tls:
  mode: acme
  acme_email: ssl@example.com
  dns_challenge: api
  acme_env_file: /etc/drumee/credential/dns-api.env
```

If that file is missing when the package configures, installation does **not**
fail: it falls back to setting up the local DNS server, and `postinst` prints
what to fix followed by `dpkg-reconfigure drumee-infra`.

### Letting Caddy handle certificates

`tls_method=caddy` hands certificate management to the `drumee-caddy` package,
which ships a Caddy built with the DNS provider modules. Install that package
first — without it the choice is refused and nginx keeps ports 80/443, so you
cannot end up with nothing listening on 443.

Interactively you are asked for the domain, the provider module (`ovh`,
`cloudflare`, `gandi`, … — it must be one the binary was built with) and the API
token. Declaratively:

```yaml
tls:
  mode: acme
  acme_email: ssl@example.com
  terminator: caddy
  dns_provider: ovh
```

The token is **never** written into `drumee.yaml` or the rendered preseed. For an
unattended install, add it yourself before `apt install`:

```bash
printf 'drumee-infra\tdrumee-infra/caddy_dns_api_key\tpassword\t%s\n' "$TOKEN" \
  | sudo debconf-set-selections
```

Configuring this way moves nginx to `8080`/`8443` (Caddy needs 80/443) and writes
`/etc/drumee/conf.d/caddy.json` plus `/etc/drumee/credential/caddy-dns.env`
(mode `0600`). Providers that need more than one credential — an application key
*and* a secret, say — take the extra values in that env file.

The packages are **self-hosted on `apt.drumee.net`** — the `drumee-static` deb alone
is ~175 MB, over GitHub's 100 MB git-file limit, so they cannot live in a Pages git
repo. Clients use a flat repo:

```
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/drumee.asc] https://apt.drumee.net/ ./
```

The signing key is served from the same host at
`https://apt.drumee.net/drumee-archive-keyring.asc`.

## Needs your infrastructure

- **VPS + DNS + TLS** — an `A`/`AAAA` record for `apt.drumee.net` pointing at the
  nginx host, and a certbot cert for it.
- **Signing key** — a project (not personal) GPG key in the publishing
  environment; CI publishes with it (Phase 5). The repo currently published is
  signed with a local build key and must be re-signed before launch.
- **Deploy key** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes the repo on a version
  tag via `scripts/publish-site.sh`. It needs these repository secrets:
  `APT_SSH_HOST` (`user@host`), `APT_SSH_KEY` (private half of a key authorized on
  the VPS), and ideally `APT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` (pinned host key — without it the
  workflow falls back to `ssh-keyscan`, i.e. trust on first use). The deploy user
  only needs write access to the doc root; CI runs `deploy-apt-repo.sh
  --no-provision`, so no sudo.

## Install ordering (resolved)

`apt` configures a package only after the packages it `Depends` on, so the
components now encode the required order (`infra → schemas → static → server → ui`)
with explicit inter-package dependencies in each `debian/control`:

| Package | Depends (ordering) |
|---|---|
| `drumee-infra` | — (base) |
| `drumee-schemas` | `drumee-infra` |
| `drumee-static` | `drumee-infra` |
| `drumee-server-pod` | `drumee-schemas`, `drumee-static` |
| `drumee-ui-pod` | `drumee-server-pod` |

So `apt install drumee` (or installing the components in any order) configures
them in dependency order without relying on the command-line order.

## Still blocked for a real build/validation here

Building the `.deb`s and validating the install end-to-end needs inputs not
present in this checkout (they live in the Drumee build environment):

| Input | Needed by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Private `@drumee` npm auth (or pre-installed `node_modules`) | every component (`bundle()` runs `npm i`) | only `infra`/`server`/`ui`/`schemas` checkouts have `node_modules`; `setup-schemas` does not |
| **Seeds archive** (`seeds.tgz`, a `mariabackup` physical backup) | `drumee-schemas` build | absent |
| **`static` source repo** | `drumee-static` build | absent |
| A **project GPG key** | signed `.deb`s + APT `Release` | absent (build unsigned with `-us -uc` for testing) |
| A disposable **Debian VM/systemd container** | running the host-reconfiguring postinst | required for true validation |
