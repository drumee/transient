/**
 * Workspace-member capability gate — the SERVER half of the role model that
 * `ui/src/drumee/builtins/skeleton/toolkit/permission.js` defines for every
 * role selector (invite popup, workspace settings, manage-access):
 *
 *   view   privilege 0b000011   read
 *   chat   privilege 0b000111   read + download      <- "download" IS the chat bit
 *   edit   privilege 0b001111   read + download + write
 *   admin  privilege 0b011111   ... + admin
 *   owner  privilege 0b111111
 *
 * The ACL already enforces the write/delete/admin tiers (`src: "write"` is
 * 0b0001000, and a chat member's 0b000111 fails it). What the ACL cannot
 * express is the CHAT tier: `channel.post` must stay reachable for a chat
 * member but not for a view-only one, and both satisfy `src: "read"`. These
 * helpers close that gap at the service layer.
 *
 * 🚨 The bit values are written out literally, NOT read from
 * `Constants.permission`, on purpose. server-essentials 1.3.0 MOVED them
 * (download 2 -> 4, write 4 -> 8). Against an older package
 * `Constants.permission.download` still resolves to 2 — which is the READ bit —
 * so a view-only member (privilege 3) would satisfy `privilege & 2` and
 * silently gain chat. Pinning the values makes the gate independent of which
 * package version happens to be installed. (A stale 1.2.44 copy really does sit
 * in some working trees, so this is not hypothetical.)
 *
 * 🚨 NEVER gate chat on `Constants.permission.chat` (0b0000110 = read|download).
 * It OVERLAPS read, so `privilege & chat` is TRUTHY for a view-only member
 * (3 & 6 = 2) and the gate silently admits exactly the role it exists to
 * exclude. Use CAN_CHAT below — the single download bit:
 *     view 3 & 4 = 0  (refused)      chat 7 & 4 = 4  (allowed)
 * The same trap applies to the ACL `src` word: use "download", never "chat".

/**
 * Resolve THIS caller's privilege on the node a hub-scoped request targets, and
 * test it against `bit`.
 *
 * Node resolution mirrors what the ACL itself does: the request's own `nid` when
 * it carries a well-formed one, else the hub root. Workspace-root chat sends
 * only `hub_id` (see ui widget/chat/index.js — `nid` is added only for a scoped
 * sub-folder thread), so the root fallback is the NORMAL path there, not an
 * edge case.
 *
 * Reads `mfs_access_node(uid, nid)` — the same authoritative read
 * `@drumee/server-core/lib/acl.js` and `channel.js::_resolveFileThreadAccess`
 * use. It returns only the CALLER's own privilege, so it can never elevate.
 *
 * SHARE SESSIONS ARE NOT TOUCHED. A DMZ / secure-share request carries a token
 * and its session is cookie-bound to the share CREATOR, so `this.uid` would
 * report the creator's full privilege and this check would be meaningless
 * anyway. Those paths have their own recipient-derived guards
 * (`media.js::_secureShareCapAllowed`, `service/lib/secure-share-write-guard`);
 * this helper defers to them by allowing immediately when a token is present.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN on any resolution failure, by design: this gate is a NEW
 * restriction layered on top of the existing ACL, so "could not determine"
 * must reproduce today's behaviour exactly rather than lock out a legitimate
 * member on a transient DB error. Same posture as
 * `secure-share-write-guard`'s null verdict. The ACL still ran first.
 *
 * @param {object} service  the service instance (`this` in a service method)
 * @param {number} bit      one of the CAN_* masks above
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} true -> may proceed; false -> caller must reject
