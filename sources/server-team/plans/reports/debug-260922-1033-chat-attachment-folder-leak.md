# Debug report: chat attachment lands in workspace Files list; bubble card latency

Date: 2026-09-22 · Stage: `aaron` endpoint (ui-team `test` @ 6e8a0362, server-team `test` @ 7ffc5c8)

## Symptom (reported)

1. Workspace chat (internal + external): attach → From device → send. Message OK, but the
   file also shows in the workspace's Files list. Deleting it from Files does not break the
   file in the message. Expected: chat attachments never appear in the workspace Files list.
2. After send, the bubble shows the attachment card slowly, sometimes never until the chat
   is reloaded by switching workspace.

## Issue 1 — root cause: CONFIRMED (deliberate behaviour, now unwanted)

Chain, verified by code + live measurement:

- `ui-team/src/drumee/builtins/widget/chat/index.js`
  - `_getUploadDestination()` (~663): every attachment uploads into the hidden staging
    `/__chat__/__upload__/` (`home.chat_upload_id`). Correct.
  - `canPromoteDeviceAttachmentsToFolder()` (~703): returns true when `postNid` is set and the
    viewer has the write bit. `initialize` (~149) sets `postNid = nid` for **workspace scope
    too** (`isHubScopedChat(scope)`), while `scopedNid` stays empty.
  - `sendMessage` (~2497): when `getPostNid()` is set, `api.nid = postNid` and
    `api.folder_attachment = getPromotableDeviceAttachmentIds(list)` (device uploads only).
- `server-team/service/private/channel.js` `post()` (~1500–1560):
  `_classify_staged_attachment` splits staged nodes into `device` (listed in
  `folder_attachment`) vs `workspace`. Device nodes are **moved into the folder `nid`**
  (`_promote_staged_to_folder` → `mfs_move_all`), then every attachment is **copied** into the
  sbox `/__chat__/<message_id>/` (`move_attachemnt` with `copy_only`), staging leftovers of
  workspace copies are purged. Result: two nodes — one in Files (original), one in the
  message (sbox copy). Deleting the Files one leaves the message copy intact → matches report.

Commits that introduced it:

| repo | commit | date | subject |
|---|---|---|---|
| server-team | 61de76e | 2026-06-05 | fix(channel): promote staged folder attachments on post |
| ui-team | 8551402b | 2026-06-05 | fix(chat): keep folder-chat attachments out of the folder until send |
| ui-team | **b04bbf66** | **2026-09-07** | fix(chat): promote workspace-chat uploads into the folder the post writes to (shipped in #560 → #564 PROD 2026-09-09) |

b04bbf66's stated goal: a device upload with no folder placement had no thread in the folder's
thread rail and "Show in folder" showed nothing. That trade-off is what the user now rejects.

Live evidence (temptest1, hub "External Workspace" 5688bc445688bc48, db 5_5688bd145688bd15):

| post variant | uploaded node after post | message node |
|---|---|---|
| `folder_attachment=[nid]` (what the UI sends) | moved to `/probe-promoted.png` (root Files) | `/__chat__/<mid>/probe-promoted.png` copy |
| no `folder_attachment` | **purged from staging** (not in media, not in trash) | `/__chat__/<mid>/probe-unpromoted.png` copy |

Browser flow (attach → From device → send in "Internal Workspace(1)", db 7_cafccfcacafccfcb)
produced the same pair: `/browser-probe.png` at root + sbox copy; card shows "Show in folder".

Conclusion: the server already implements the wanted behaviour for the no-`folder_attachment`
case. The fix is client-side: stop sending `folder_attachment` (and stop setting `postNid` for
promotion) — at minimum for workspace scope; the DMZ folder-scope (8551402b) needs the same
decision. Side effects to accept: no folder thread-rail entry / "Show in folder" for device
uploads (the b04bbf66 rationale), `tests/chat-upload-promotion.test.js` must be updated.
Server-side `_promote_staged_to_folder` can stay (dead when the client never asks).

## Issue 2 — root cause CONFIRMED (personal desk folder chat), fix in schemas #186

Update 2026-09-22 13:xx: Aaron's failing sends were on his **personal desk** (hub_id == uid,
folder `/Photos`), not on a team hub. Server log for that account: `channel.post` GRANTED →
TERMINATED but **no `chat.attachment` re-fetch afterwards**. API repro on temptest1's own hub:
response carried `_db_err` = "Column 'entity_id' cannot be null" and **no `message_id`**, while
the channel row WAS inserted. Cause: drumate variant of `channel_post_message`, non-hub branch,
bumps `time_channel` with `_entity_id` (P2P peer, only `chat.post` sends it); `channel.post` has
no peer → NULL into NOT NULL PK → EXIT HANDLER returns error JSON instead of the row → client
optimistic bubble never gets `message_id` → no card, until reload loads the stored row.
Explains both "gửi không được" and "bubble hiện nhưng không open được, refresh thì được".
Pre-existing (Aaron's 04:11 rows show the same shape), independent of today's ui change.

Fix: `drumate/procedures/channel/channel_post_message.sql` — skip the `time_channel` insert when
`_entity_id IS NULL`. Applied to temptest1's DB only (`c_2fb5e0422fb5e043`); after: full row,
`message_id`, `attachment=[{hub_id:<wicket>,nid}]`, `chat.attachment` 1 item privilege 63.
Pre-fix source: `/root/chat-perm-backup/channel_post_message-drumate-before-fix-20260922.sql`.
PR: https://github.com/drumee/schemas/pull/186 (base preview). Rolled out on Aaron's go
2026-09-22 13:23 to all **450/450** stage drumate DBs that carry the routine (joined through
`yp.entity type='drumate'`), 0 failures, verified by body scan. Bulk `mysql.proc` dump captured
0 rows (the `--where` subquery matched nothing) — rollback reference is the pre-fix source at
`/root/chat-perm-backup/channel_post_message-drumate-before-fix-20260922.sql`, which matched the
body read from temptest1's DB before the change. Post-deploy probe: full row + 1 attachment item.

Issue 1 fix: ui-team https://github.com/drumee/ui-team/pull/618 (base test), on stage `aaron`.

### Earlier team-hub measurement (kept for reference)

Client already has the re-fetch fix (#583, 2026-09-11, `chat-item/index.js _onDataChanged`:
list `restart()` when `message_id` arrives on the optimistic row). Deployed build includes it.

Measured on stage (probe hooks on XHR/fetch + MutationObserver, temptest1):

| step | 704 KB PNG (browser) | 12 MB PNG (API) |
|---|---|---|
| media.upload | 3.13 s | 5.83 s |
| channel.post | 0.42 s | 1.12 s |
| chat.attachment (re-fetch) | 0.88–0.94 s | 1.06 s |
| send click → card in bubble | **1.58 s** | n/a (server part is size-independent) |

Timeline of one send: first `chat.attachment` fires at +159 ms with `message_id` undefined
(expected, evaluated once at list construction), echo arrives +440 ms, `restart()` re-fetch
+625 ms → card at +1.58 s. Server times do not grow with file size (`mfs-copy-node.sh` `cp -rf`
on 12 MB is still ~1.1 s total).

Unverified hypothesis for the "never shows" case (PLAUSIBLE, not confirmed): `handleReceivedMsg`
matches the echo with `this.echoId == data.echoId`, and `this.echoId` is overwritten by the next
`sendMessage`. A second send before the first response makes the first response miss the
echo branch → appended as a new row while the optimistic row keeps no `message_id` → its card
never loads. Needs a two-quick-sends repro to confirm. Browser tab was reset by the tool when
loading an 11 MB file, so the large-file browser timing is missing.

## Cleanup

All probe nodes trashed via `media.trash` (3 in External Workspace, 1 in Internal Workspace(1)).
Probe messages remain in those two temptest chats. Browser session closed.

## Unresolved questions

- Should DMZ folder-scoped chat (8551402b) also stop promoting, or only workspace scope?
- Accept losing folder thread-rail / "Show in folder" for device uploads (b04bbf66 rationale)?
- Does the "never shows" case involve sending a second message before the first returns?

## Issue 3 — "From workspace" picker cannot reach files (reported 14:46) — root cause CONFIRMED, fixed

Symptom: attach → From workspace lists the rows, clicking a workspace pops "This file type is
not supported"; the flow never reaches a file.

Cause (by design of the original feature, not a regression): `_openDeskPicker` (ui-team
`widget/chat/index.js`, shipped in `3c88ae0b` 2026-05-17) fed ONE flat `media.show_node_by`
listing of the user's own home root and `_pickDeskFile` rejected every `hub`/`folder` row with
`Wm.alert(FILE_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED)`. The rows the user reads as "workspaces" (Photos,
Documents, …) are home-root folders; hub workspaces were in the same list. No drill-down
existed, so only a loose file at the home root was ever pickable. The console lines
`__window_manager: AAA:471 The method *undefined*` are the alert's Close click bubbling to
the window manager — a side effect of the alert, gone with it.

Fix (ui-team PR `fix/chat-workspace-picker-navigation` → test): the picker now opens on the
desk-sidebar rows (`desk.home type=all`, hub rows gated on area share|private|restricted|public
like `desk_workspace-list`), a hub/folder row pushes onto `_deskPickerTrail` and re-feeds the
list with `media.show_node_by {hub_id, nid}` (hub rows use `actual_home_id`, as
`Wm.loadWorkspace`), a Back control pops the trail, a file row runs the unchanged
copy-to-staging attach path. Rows are typed by class (`--hub`, `--folder`, `--file`).

Verified on stage (temptest1, chat in External Workspace 5688bc445688bc48):
root → 6 rows (1 personal folder, 3 hubs, 2 probe folders); hub row → Back + contents; folder
row → its file; file row → chip staged; send → bubble card 188 KB. API after send: original
still in the personal folder, External Workspace root unchanged (no Files-list leak).
Seeded probe files trashed afterwards.

Not covered: the `file/orig/<a>/<b>?keysel=regsid` 404s in the user's console — the two `<a>`
ids are not `yp.entity` rows; needs the message ids from the user's account to trace.

Follow-ups (same day): rows restyled like the @-mention rows (desk icon by area, file
extension, loading skeleton; PR #620 merged), then on Aaron's decision the picker was
re-anchored at the chat's OWN workspace only — team hub → hub home root, personal-desk chat →
its personal workspace folder (`getPostNid`), DMZ share → shared folder; hub rows dropped,
no Back above the root (commit on `test`, verified on stage with temptest1 for the personal
folder chat and the External Workspace chat).

## Issue 4 — From workspace: card without preview, Open → "A network error has occurred" (2026-09-23)

Report: upload an image to the workspace (renders and opens fine), attach it via From
workspace, send — the bubble shows the file name but no thumbnail, Open fails with the
generic network error. Aaron: 100% with a fresh upload; intermittent otherwise.

Evidence (stage, uid 97b24b3d97b24b42, requests land on the `main-service` cluster 93–96):

| UTC      | request                         | source → staged → sbox node                        | sbox folder on disk |

Every failing message row (`1_97b24c1397b24c14.channel.attachment`) points at a sbox node whose
storage folder is EMPTY: no `vignette.png` → card has no preview; no `orig.*` → Open fetches
`file/orig/<nid>/<hub>` → 404 → `LOCALE.ERROR_NETWORK`. The mov additionally raised
`Video FAILED TO RUN SERVICE video.master … null 'join'` (INVALID VIDEO INFO). Yesterday's
console 404 `file/orig/f8fe9787f8fe9789/cac552d4cac552db` is the same thing: message
f8fa969b (2026-09-22 05:53) → sbox node f8fe9787 whose folder has been empty since then.
Fresh upload is NOT the discriminator — two May-2026 workspace files failed the same way and
one fresh png succeeded. It is a race.

Root cause (server-team `service/private/channel.js`, both `post` and `file_thread_post`):

1. `move_attachemnt()` copies the staged node into the sbox with `copy_node(src, dest, 1)`
   — `detach=1` makes server-core spawn `/usr/share/drumee/bin/mfs-copy-node.sh` detached and
   return immediately (`ln -s src dest; mkdir dest.tpm; cp -rf src/* dest.tpm; rm -f dest;
   mv dest.tpm dest`). Nothing awaits the bytes.
2. A few ms later, still inside the same request (the whole post took 55 ms:
   09:43:10.073 → .128), `_purge_staged_copies(staged.workspace)` deletes the staging node:
   `mfs_attachment_remove` + synchronous `remove_node()` → `rm -rf <staged>`.
3. The in-process rm almost always beats bash start-up + `cp`, so `cp -rf src/*` finds no
   files, and `mv dest.tpm dest` leaves an empty sbox folder that the committed message
   already references.

Replayed on the stage box with the exact spawn order (script then rm) on scratch dirs:
20/20 destinations empty. Introduced by `111b831` (2026-05-19, detached copy to staging) +
`61de76e` (2026-06-05, purge staged copies after post); deployed on main (server 2.9.94).
The picker's first hop (`media.copy` → `after_transact` → `copy_node(…, 1)`) is the same
detached script but its source is never deleted, so it is not the failing step; direct chat
(`service/private/chat.js`) uses synchronous `copy_node`/`remove_node` and is unaffected.

Fix direction (not applied): make the sbox copy synchronous in `move_attachemnt`
(`copy_node(src, dest)` → `cpSync`, same as chat.js) or, if the detached script must stay,
purge the staging node only after the copy has landed (await the child / verify `orig.*`
exists in the sbox folder before `_purge_staged_copies`). Existing broken cards
(2ff40dba, 38ee451b, f8fe9787 in hub cac552d4) keep empty folders; their staging sources are
already purged, so they cannot be repaired from disk.

Fix applied (server-team `c484f8d` on `test`, 2026-09-23): new `service/private/_node-storage.js`
exports `copyNodeStorage(src, dest)` — an awaited `fs/promises.cp` (recursive, `dereference`
so a staging path that is still the desk copy's symlink is followed) built on MfsTools
`check_base`/`get_base`/`check_safety`; `channel.js move_attachemnt` uses it in place of both
`copy_node(src, dest, 1)` calls, so `_purge_staged_copies` only runs once the sbox bytes are
on disk. Desk copy (`private/media.js`), direct chat (`chat.js`) and the shell script are
untouched.

Verified on stage `aaron` (temptest1, personal folder c6157887c615788c, API replay of the UI
flow: fresh upload → 1.5 s → `media.copy` → 1.5 s → `channel.post`): 3/3 sbox folders hold
`orig.png` + `vignette.png`, `file/orig` and `file/vignette` answer 200 for all three, the
three staging copies are purged, no orphan folders. Awaited-copy replay of the spawn order on
the stage box: 0/20 empty (was 20/20). Test uploads and staging leftovers trashed; the six
probe messages in temptest1's personal folder chat could not be deleted —
`channel.delete` fails there with `PROCEDURE c_2fb5e0422fb5e043.channel_delete_hub_all does
not exist` (stage schema gap, pre-existing, not touched).

Still open: the `main` endpoint Aaron tests on runs the old code until `test` is deployed
there; cards already broken (`2ff40dba`, `38ee451b`, `f8fe9787` in hub cac552d4) stay empty.

## Issue 5 — many files in one message: long wait, only 5 cards (2026-09-24, lexishoang.drumee.in)

Evidence (stage `main-service`, uid 70ba905970ba905d, share hub a8083fe4a8083feb, folder
a8957928a8957932, 09:52–10:06 UTC):

| UTC      | post GRANTED → TERMINATED | files stored in `channel.attachment` | on disk |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| 09:52:47 | 62 ms                     | 1                                    | ok      |
| 09:55:14 | 405 ms                    | 10                                   | 10/10 have bytes |
| 10:01:15 | **5 849 ms**              | **36**                               | 36/36 have bytes (one mp4 = 844 MB) |
| 10:01:41 | 17 ms                     | text: "ủa sao upload 1 đống mà còn ít" | — |

So the server kept every attachment; nothing was dropped at post time.

Root cause of "only 5": `server-team/service/private/chat.js attachment()` pages the stored
list five at a time — `attach = data.attachment.slice((page - 1) * 5, page * 5)` — and the
bubble's card list (`ui-team widget/chat-item/index.js`, `Skeletons.List.Smart` with
`api: getAttachments`, `flow: none`, no height) never scrolls, so the base list's
`_onScroll` paging never asks for page 2. Log confirms one `chat.attachment` call per message
(page 1, 2–10 ms) and no page 2. Every message with more than 5 attachments shows 5.

Root cause of "long wait": the bubble is drawn optimistically and fires `chat.attachment`
at once (10:01:15.988, message not stored yet → empty → skeleton), then again only after
`channel.post` returns (10:01:22.166). The post itself took 5.85 s for 36 files (0.4 s for
10): per-file work inside one request — `_classify_staged_attachment` SELECT per nid,
`mfs_copy_all` over 36 nodes, 36 detached copy spawns, `_purge_staged_copies` (36 ×
`mfs_attachment_remove` + `rm -rf`), `channel_post_attachment` loop. Roughly 160 ms per file.
Note for the fix shipped in `c484f8d` (awaited `fs.cp` instead of the detached script): on a
message like this one the 844 MB copy now runs inside the request as well, so heavy posts get
slower still. The staging node is purged right after the copy, so a rename
(`move_node`, O(1) on the same volume) instead of copy + purge would remove both the race
and the copy cost; `mfs_move_all` emits copy+delete rows for cross-DB moves (personal hub →
sbox hub), so that path needs a rename fallback for those rows.

Fix direction (not applied): (1) `chat.attachment` returns the whole list (or the bubble
requests pages until `_e.eod`); (2) replace copy + purge of staging nodes with a move.

Fix applied (2026-09-24, order A1 → B1 → C1 from
`plans/reports/brainstorm-260924-2225-chat-multi-attachment-perf.md`):

- A1 `7d76460` — `chat.js attachment()` returns the whole stored list; `page` is only echoed on
  the rows (the ui-core list always sends `page=1`, so opt-in paging was not an option).
- B1 `7d76460` + `25e2080` — `channel.js`: verified staging nodes are MOVED into the sbox
  (`mfs_move_all` + rename) through `_attach_to_sbox`; anything the classifier did not vouch
  for keeps the awaited copy; `_purge_staged_copies` no longer runs after a post; the
  classifier looks the nids up in one query. Same-hub moves (team/share hub) carry no `'move'`
  row, the node keeps its id, so the sources are the entries.
- C1 ui-team (`test`) — composer hands the staged node rows to the optimistic bubble
  (`attachment_preview`, `media-wrapper.getAttachmentNodes()` stripped of picker/strip widget
  fields); the bubble feeds them to its card list, retires the placeholder at once, and skips
  the refetch when the echo's entries match; a cross-hub move refetches with `start(0)` so
  the cards never blank.

Stage results (aaron): 12 files incl. 15 MB → post 1.25 s, 12 cards, 12/12 folders with
bytes, 0 staging rows left; 36 files → 1.2 s (was 5.85 s), 36 cards; team hub 8 files → 8
cards, 8/8 bytes. Browser (temptest1): team hub send → card at 164–176 ms, placeholder gone,
0 `chat.attachment` calls; personal folder send → card at 178 ms, 1 `chat.attachment`, no
blank while the stored rows replace the preview. Seeded files trashed; probe messages remain
in temptest1's chats.

Side notes: the picker's copy shows an "Uploading 1 file" progress row that can linger with a
"Cancel" control when the same file is picked twice; the ui `upload` of files through the
hidden `input[type=file]` did not trigger the messenger's handler in automation, so the
device-upload path was covered by the API replay only.
