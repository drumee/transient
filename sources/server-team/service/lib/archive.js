 * Drumee produced is always one it can read back.
 *
 * TWO VERSIONS ARE IN PLAY AND BOTH MUST WORK: p7zip 16.02 inside the
 * production `drumee` container, 7-Zip 25.01 on stage. Their human-readable
 * `7z l` tables differ in column layout; `-slt` ("show technical") is the one

 * and nothing else. Verified on both hosts before this was written.

 * headers are not compressed. The DECODER is a separate, non-free codec and it
 * is absent on both: 7-Zip 25.01 on stage lists 35 codecs and not one is RAR,
 * and the p7zip 16.02 container has no /usr/lib/p7zip/Codecs/ directory at all
 * (that is where Rar29.so would live). Verified on both, 2026-09-10.
 *
 * The trap this creates is specific and nasty: a STORE-mode rar extracts fine
 * because nothing needs decoding, so a hand-made fixture passes while every
 * real rar — WinRAR compresses by default — fails at extraction time with
 * "Unsupported Method", i.e. AFTER the user has already confirmed. Listing
 * cannot tell us either, since the method is per entry and the headers parse
