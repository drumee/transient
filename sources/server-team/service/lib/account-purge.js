//   Used by drumate.delete_account (self-service). private/role.js still
//   carries its own inline copy of the workspace loop in member_delete and
//   member_disconnect -- those two differ in their final call (drumate_delete
//   vs drumate_vanish) and are admin flows that cannot be exercised on stage,
//   so they are deliberately left alone here and should migrate onto this
//   helper separately, with the admin path actually tested. What must never
//   diverge -- WHICH rows a delete removes -- lives in the drumate_delete
//   procedure that every hard-delete caller already shares.
