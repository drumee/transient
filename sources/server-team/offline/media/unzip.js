/**
 * Extract an uploaded archive into the workspace it already lives in.
 *
 * Runs detached, spawned by media.unzip, for the reason the whole feature
 * exists: a zip in Drumee is almost always a zipped FOLDER, so the work is
 * "decompress a few hundred MB and then create a few thousand media rows",
 * which is nobody's idea of a request/response cycle.
 *
 * The node-creation half deliberately mirrors offline/media/serverimport.js —
 * same node shape, same `mfs_import` bulk insert, same `media.new` push — so
 * files that arrive by unzip are indistinguishable from files that arrive by
 * any other import, and there is one shape to maintain rather than two.
 *
 * SAFETY IS SPLIT ACROSS TWO PLACES ON PURPOSE. media.unzip refuses hostile
 * archives BEFORE spawning us (traversal paths, encryption, entry-count and
 * size ceilings, quota) because that is where a user can be told why. What is
 * left here is what only the extracted bytes can tell us, and it is enforced
 * by construction: we walk the staging directory with lstat and import only
 * regular files and directories, so a symlink restored out of an archive is
 * skipped rather than followed, and anything 7z somehow wrote outside the
 * staging directory is simply never seen.
